## Lessons Learned

1. tailwind is utility first css framework, react is component first js framework
2. To create a new nextjs project execute - `npx create-next-app@latest', change to project directory via cd command and then run npm run dev or npm run build
3. Nextjs is useful as it automatically cofigures low-level tools like bundlers and compilers
4. Next.js uses file-based routing, which means the folder and file structure in  project automatically creates routes - you don't need to write routing configuration code.
5. Types of routing:
   a. static routing eg. pages/about.js → /about
   b. nested routing eg. pages/blog/posts.js → /blog/posts
   c. dynamic routing eg. pages/blog/[id].js → /blog/1, /blog/2, /blog/any-slug 
   d. catch-all routing eg. pages/docs/[...slug].js → /docs/a, /docs/a/b, /docs/a/b/c

| Route file        | eg. about.js              | eg. about/page.js                |
| Default component | Client Component          | Server Component                 |
| Data fetching     | getServerSideProps        | fetch()in component              |
| Layouts           | Static_app.js             | Nestedlayout.js                  |
| Complexity        | Simpler                   | More advanced                    |
| When to use       | Simple sites, SEO-focused | Complex apps, better performance |
| History           | Traditional - Next.js 12  | New - Next.js 13+                |
|                   |  and earlier              |                                  |
7. App router uses two directives "use client" and "use server"
