# Week 2 – Frontend Learning Journey

## Day 1 – Semantic HTML & Structure
On the first day, I focused on building clean and meaningful page structures using semantic HTML tags like **`header`**, **`main`**, **`section`**, **`article`**, and **`nav`**.  
I also practiced creating accessible forms and explored media elements such as **`video`**, **`audio`**, and **`canvas`**.  
To apply all the concepts, I built a simple blog layout using semantic elements only.

## Day 2 – CSS Foundations & Layout Systems
On Day 2, I worked with CSS selectors, the box model, spacing, units, and the importance of specificity.  
I learned both **Flexbox** (1D layout) and **CSS Grid** (2D layout) and used them to design responsive page sections.  
I also practiced media queries for mobile-first design and added basic transitions to make UI interactions smoother.

## Day 3 – JavaScript Basics + DOM Manipulation
This day was dedicated to JavaScript fundamentals — variables, arrow functions, arrays, objects, and commonly used methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.  
I also learned how to manipulate the DOM by building small UI components such as a mobile navbar and an FAQ accordion.

I created an interactive FAQ section where clicking a question toggles its answer.  
I also used events like `click`, `keydown`, and custom handlers to make components dynamic.

## Day 4 – Utilities, Debugging & LocalStorage Project
On Day 4, I explored how to break JavaScript into smaller reusable functions and practiced writing defensive code using **try/catch**.  
I also used **DevTools breakpoints** and **watch expressions** to debug step-by-step.

The main project for the day was a **Todo App** with LocalStorage persistence.  
It included all essential features: **Add**, **Edit**, **Delete**, and **Mark Complete**, and all tasks remain saved even after refreshing.

I also implemented simple error handling using a `logs/errors.md` file.

## Day 5 – E-commerce Product Listing Project
The final project of the week brought together everything I learned.  
I built an **E-commerce product listing page** with:

- **fetch API** + async/await  
- **try/catch** for safe data loading  
- **debounced search filtering**  
- **sorting (high → low)**  
- **simple product card layout**  
- **responsive design**  

Products are fetched from DummyJSON and displayed with images, titles, and prices.

## Summary
This week helped me connect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into complete, functional UI projects.  
By the end, I built two fully working pages: a Todo App with persistence and an E-commerce Product Listing page with fetch, search, and sort.
